[info] i  extensions: answer the questions below to configure your extension:
[info] 
Cloud Functions location: Where do you want to deploy the functions created for this extension?  You usually want a location close to your Storage bucket. For help selecting a  location, refer to the location selection  guide (https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/locations).
[info] 
Cloud Storage bucket for images: To which Cloud Storage bucket will you upload images that you want to resize? Resized images will be stored in this bucket. Depending on your extension configuration, original images are either kept or deleted.
[info] 
Sizes of resized images: What sizes of images would you like (in pixels)? Enter the sizes as a comma-separated list of WIDTHxHEIGHT values. Learn more about how this parameter works (https://firebase.google.com/products/extensions/storage-resize-images).
